# 3D models generation

To generate 3D models I've used the free open source editor [3D Object Maker](https://lrusso.github.io/3DObjectMaker/3DObjectMaker.htm) which produces .stl files that can be converted to .obj with any of the online converters (in my case [Aspose](https://products.aspose.app/3d/conversion/stl-to-obj)). Eventually, UV mapping has been generated with Blender.
